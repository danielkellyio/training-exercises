# Single File Components

In Vue 3, a single file component (SFC) is a .vue file that encapsulates a Vue component's template, script, and style in a single file. Vue 3's reactivity system enables automatic reactivity and data binding between the template and the component's data properties, allowing changes in the component's data to automatically update the template and vice versa. This provides a modular and organized way to develop Vue components in a single file, with clear separation of concerns for template, script, and style.
